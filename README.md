# Voronoi-Delaunay

This is an implementation and visualization of Voronoi diagram and Delaunay triangulation of a set of point. 

In this implementation, Voronoi diagram is obtained from generating its dual, Delaunay triangulation.

And Delaunay triangulation is derived in a very simple and na√Øve mannar, Bowyer-Watson algorithm, which takes O(n^2) time.
